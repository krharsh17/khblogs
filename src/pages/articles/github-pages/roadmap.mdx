intro: I‚Äôve decided to create a detailed guide on GitHub Pages, a platform used by over 40 million developers to host their projects as well as static webpages. I see a lot of beginners struggling to configure the service correctly on their projects, and more often than not risk themselves towards alarming issues such as domain takeover, security key exposure etc.

Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve decided to create a detailed guide on GitHub Pages, a platform used by over 40 million developers to host their projects as well as static webpages. I see a lot of beginners struggling to configure the service correctly on their projects, and more often than not risk themselves towards alarming issues such as domain takeover, security key exposure etc.

This guide is meant to serve as a descriptive version of the [official GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages), as I believe that a few topics could be explained in a more beginner-friendly way.

Here‚Äôs the list of topics that I‚Äôll be describing:

- [What is GitHub Pages](https://blog.krharsh17.vision/articles/github-pages/what-is-github-pages)
- Creating a GitHub Pages website
- Configuring a publishing source for your website
- Creating a custom 404 page for your website
- GitHub Pages and HTTPS
- Submodules with Pages
- Configuring a custom domain for your website
- Configuring a subdomain for your website
- Common issues faced while setting up Pages
- [BONUS] GitHub Pages Command-Line Interface
- [BONUS] React CI with GitHub Pages

I‚Äôll update each topic here with its link when it is ready. Also, due to the paywall restrictions, I will not post all of my articles here on medium. I‚Äôve just finished setting up my own blog in React (Yay!) and I‚Äôll compile all of my articles there itself. Here‚Äôs the link to it ‚Äî [‚úçüèª](https://blog.krharsh17.vision)

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/krharsh17) for more updates about this series.

Happy coding!
