The coolest thing about this service is that it integrates directly with your codebase, ie. your code's repository, so deploying a site on GitHub Pages means simply pushing your files onto your GitHub Repository, and the GitHub Pages system then takes your bunch of files, optionally passes them through a build sequence and then deploys it to the github.io subdomain assigned to your repo.","imgUrl":"https://source.unsplash.com/fDghTk7Typw/800x800","articleNumber":3}}}}
